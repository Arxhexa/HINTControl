# Installing

Check the Releases page for binaries.

On macOS, extract the downloaded ZIP, then right-click the .app file and choose "Open". The first try will likely result in an error. Close the error dialog and try again and you should see a dialog with an "Open" button show up.

For iOS, you'll need to use something like [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) or [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) to install the .ipa file.
